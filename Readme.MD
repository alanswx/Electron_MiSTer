This is a port of ElctronFPGA by David Banks, Mike Sterling.
I used the front end for the BBC Micro by Sorgelig and adapted it for this port.

As usual with a first port from me it's not perfect. It is fixed in 60hz video
my clumsy attempt at having a variable video clock is not working yet.

On start up you will need to ctrl-Break to clear the garbage on the screen. -- fix me

I put an Electron version of beeb.mmb on the 2nd SD card and was instructed to type *DBOOT 100

This didnt work. I had to type 	*DIN GAMES
								CHAIN "GMENU"
								
Other files Have to be *EXEC

The only one that would boot was Elite.

I cannot get used to the Func Number for Function Keys. -- Func = Caps Lock


I never had an Electron and the only time I saw one was when it was being used as a door stop
in the 'One Step Beyond' shop in Norwich.
